        <p>An aspiring data science enthusiast who enjoys connecting the dots: 
            be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, 
            or applications from different industries. I have adequate technical skills and 
            an academic background in engineering, statistics, and machine learning. 
            Additionally, I have formidable business knowledge which significantly helps me in the pathway of data science 
            because business/ domain knowledge is one of the major criteria/ skills in the data science field. 
            My passion lies in solving business problems with tailored data and algorithms 
            and communicating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders. 
            I can jump across verticals to deliver high-performing AI solutions.</p>
